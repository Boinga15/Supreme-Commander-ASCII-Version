# Supreme-Commander-ASCII-Version
A fanmade ASCII version of Supreme Commander.

*SEIZURE WARNING: THE GAME OVER AND VICTORY SCREEN CURRENTLY HAS SEIZURE INDUCING SCREENS. DO NOT PLAY IF YOU SUFFER FROM EPILLEPTIC SEIZURES*

The original Supreme Commander was made by Square Enix. This is just a fanmade version I made for fun.

This is a two-player turn-based game based on Supreme Commander, requiring that you manage your resources and army in order to claim victory over your opponent. Note that the game currently isn't completely finished, as there are a few bugs that need to be patched out. For any programmers out there, feel free to improve on this game as you see fit.

I'll continue to do my best to improve this game in the meantime. Right now, the game is technically playable.

Currently known bugs:
- The game lags severely whenever loads of units are on screen (I think this is because of the fog of war checks).
- Shields may not work.
